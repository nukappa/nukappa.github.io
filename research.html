		<h2>Flexible spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/nat_protocols.webp" width="80px" height="100px" Style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">
			<p>novoSpaRc is a computational framework that probabilistically assigns cells 
				to tissue locations. At the core of this framework lies a structural 
				correspondence hypothesis, that cells in physical proximity share similar 
				gene expression profiles. Given scRNA-seq data, novoSpaRc spatially 
				reconstructs tissues based on this hypothesis, and optionally, by 
				including a reference atlas of marker genes to improve reconstruction.

		<h2>Gene expression cartography</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/novosparc.png" width="100px" height="100px" Style="float: right; margin-left: 15px">
			<p> Reconstruct spatial positions with little or no prior knowledge, by searching for 
				spatial arrangements of sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional 
				profiles that are often more similar than cells that are further apart. 
				We formulate this task as a generalized optimal-transport problem for 
				probabilistic embedding and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve 
				it. <a href="publications.html#p18">[18]</a></p>

		<h2>FLAM-seq: full-length mRNA sequencing</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Although messenger RNAs are key molecules for understanding life, 
				until now, no method has existed to determine the full-length 
				sequence of endogenous mRNAs including their poly(A) tails. Moreover, 
				although non-A nucleotides can be incorporated in poly(A) tails, there 
				also exists no method to accurately sequence them. Here, we present 
				full-length poly(A) and mRNA sequencing (FLAM-seq), a rapid and simple 
				method for high-quality sequencing of entire mRNAs. We report a 
				complementary DNA library preparation method coupled to single-molecule 
				sequencing to perform FLAM-seq. Using human cell lines, brain 
				organoids and Caenorhabditis elegans we show that FLAM-seq delivers 
				high-quality full-length mRNA sequences for thousands of different 
				genes per sample.<a href="publications.html#p17">[17]</a></p>

        <p>The common fruitfly has many similarities with the human species. This unexpected fact has 
			helped us to understand basic genetic principles and identify disease genes. I used single 
			cell RNA data and machine learning algorithms to create a virtual <i>Drosophila</i> early embryo 
			that can be queried for the expression of any given 
			gene <a href="publications.html#15">[15]</a>. 
			I created an interactive online tool that provides the transcriptional information along the 
			virtual embryo and can be used as a resource: <a href="http://www.dvex.org">DVEX</a>.</p>

        <p>It is now possible to quickly obtain the RNA of thousands of single cells at low cost. 
			As it is critical to preserve the natural cell states, we developed a cell fixation method
			which stabilises the cells and preserves them over time 
			<a href="publications.html#p14">[14]</a>. In close communication with the experimentalists, 
			I performed the whole computational and statistical analysis of the data.</p>

        <p>Functional quantum computers will be able to perform computations at ultra high speed and 
			accuracy. A topological quantum computer is based on exotic quasi-particles called anyons, 
			a family of which has been though experimentally detected. My research in this field focused 
			on extracting mathematical structures that allowed us to solve the corresponding systems 
			exactly <a href="publications.html#p10">[10]</a>

        <img src="images/fermions.png" width="100px" height="100px" Style="float: right; margin-left: 15px">
        <p text-align: justify;>Fermions are a large class of particles which obey the			 
			exclusion principle discovered by Pauli. Most fundamental blocks of matter are 
			fermions, namely all quarks and leptons, such as the electron. 
			The interactions between fermions are non-trivial, especially 
			because of their intrinsic properties. We solved a model of a 
			1-dimensional lattice of interacting fermions subject to boundary 
			conditions <a href="publications.html#p8">[8]</a>. I then 
			generalized the boundary conditions to a large unstudied family 
			of supersymmetric models

        <h2>Impurities, imperfections, defects</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/impurity.jpg" width="100px" Style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">
        <p>Another route to bridge the gap between theory and nature is to consider impurities. 
			Quite often, the theoretical models are far too homogeneous to capture physical signals. 
			Since nature is almost always not homogeneous, or perfect, these impurities are also called 
			imperfections, or defects. I was excited to work out the consequences of introducing such 
			impurities in diverse frameworks including sigma models 
			<a href="publications.html#p6">[6]</a>, spin chain impurities 
			<a href="publications.html#p7">[7]</a> and impurity generation 
			boundaries <a href="publications.html#p11">[11]</a>,

        <h2>Life in 10 dimensions</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/calabi_yau.jpg" width="100px" Style="float: right; margin-left: 15px">
        <p>String theory started as a promising attempt to unify all physical interactions and 
			ended up being a vast compilation of mathematical theories and physical concepts. 
			According to string theory, our world is 10-dimensional. Peculiar objects roam on those 
			high-dimensional spaces and interact in even more peculiar manners with each other. 
			Fascinated by the beauty of the mathematical structures, I worked on finding new ways to 
			embed those objects on sphere submanifolds <a href="publications.html#p4">[4]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Boundary conditions: when theory moves towards reality</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/reflection.png" width="100px" Style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">
        <p>Many theoretical physics models are solvable because they are unrealistic. 
			We can extract, however, fruitful insights and qualitative information by studying 
			these models. I got early on interested in finding ways to bridging that gap.
			In spin chains, one way forward is to introduce boundary conditions so that the 
			particles reflect on the edges. The system is no longer infinite, so that finite 
			size effects become important. This work resulted in three publications 
			<a href="publications.html#p1">[1]</a>, <a href="publications.html#p2">[2]</a>,
			<a href="publications.html#p5">[5]</a> 
			and a review article <a href="publications.html#p3">[3]</a>.</p>
