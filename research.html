		<h2>Flexible spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression</h2>
		<div>

			<p>novoSpaRc is a computational framework that probabilistically assigns cells 
				to tissue locations. At the core of this framework lies a structural 
				correspondence hypothesis, that cells in physical proximity share similar 
				gene expression profiles. Given scRNA-seq data, novoSpaRc spatially 
				reconstructs tissues based on this hypothesis, and optionally, by 
				including a reference atlas of marker genes to improve reconstruction.</p>

			<img src="images/novosparc.png" width="100px" height="100px" Style="float: right; margin-left: 15px">
			<p> Reconstruct spatial positions with little or no prior knowledge, by searching for 
				spatial arrangements of sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional 
				profiles that are often more similar than cells that are farther apart. 
				We formulate this task as a generalized optimal-transport problem for 
				probabilistic embedding and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve 
				it. </p>

		<h2>The virtual fly embryo</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/embryos.png" width="100px" height="100px" Style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">
        <p>The common fruitfly has many similarities with the human species. This unexpected fact has helped us to understand basic genetic principles and identify disease genes. I used single cell RNA data and machine learning algorithms to create a virtual <i>Drosophila</i> early embryo that can be queried for the expression of any given gene <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/17/117382">[15]</a>. I created an interactive online tool that provides the transcriptional information along the virtual embryo and can be used as a resource: <a href="http://www.dvex.org">DVEX</a>.</p>

        <h2>Fixing and preserving precious RNA material in single cells</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/fixation.png" width="100px" height="105px" Style="float: right; margin-left: 15px">
        <p>It is now possible to quickly obtain the RNA of thousands of single cells at low cost. As it is critical to preserve the natural cell states, we developed a cell fixation method which stabilises the cells and preserves them over time <a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0383-5">[14]</a>. In close communication with the experimentalists, I performed the whole computational and statistical analysis of the data and developed an R package for easy exploratory data analysis <a href="https://github.com/nukappa/dropbead">[Github]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Topological quanum computer elements</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/anyons.png" width="100px" height="100px" Style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">
        <p>Functional quantum computers will be able to perform computations at ultra high speed and accuracy. A topological quantum computer is based on exotic quasi-particles called anyons, a family of which has been though experimentally detected. My research in this field focused on extracting mathematical structures that allowed us to solve the corresponding systems exactly <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4338">[11]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6883">[12]</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00822">[13]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Interacting fermions: a &middot; b = -b &middot; a</h2>
        <div style="clear: both;">
        <img src="images/fermions.png" width="100px" height="100px" Style="float: right; margin-left: 15px">
        <p text-align: justify;>Fermions are a big class of particles which obey an important exclusion principle discovered by Pauli. Most fundamental blocks of matter are fermions, namely all quarks and leptons, such as the electron. The interactions between fermions can be non-trivial, particularly because of their intrinsic properties. I worked on and solverd a model of a 1-dimensional lattice of interacting fermions subject to peculiar boundary conditions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2659">[9]</a>. I then generalized the boundary conditions for an unstudied family of supersymmetric models <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4146">[10]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Impurities, imperfections, defects</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/impurity.jpg" width="100px" Style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">
        <p>Another route to bridge the gap between theory and nature is to consider impurities. Quite often, the theoretical models are far too homogeneous to capture physical signals. Since nature is almost always not homogeneous, or perfect, these impurities are also called imperfections, or defects. I was excited to work out the consequences of introducing such impurities in diverse frameworks including sigma models <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5503">[5]</a>, spin chain impurities <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0195">[6]</a> and impurity generation boundaries <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5991">[7]</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6480">[8]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Life in 10 dimensions</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/calabi_yau.jpg" width="100px" Style="float: right; margin-left: 15px">
        <p>String theory started as a promising attempt to unify all physical interactions and ended up being a vast compilation of mathematical theories and physical concepts. According to string theory, our world is 10-dimensional. Peculiar objects roam on those high-dimensional spaces and interact in even more peculiar manners with each other. Fascinated by the beauty of the mathematical structures, I worked on finding new ways to embed those objects on sphere submanifolds <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1200">[4]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Boundary conditions: when theory steps towards reality</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/reflection.png" width="100px" Style="float: left; margin-right: 15px">
        <p>We can solve many models in theoretical physics for a good reason: they are unrealistic. 
			This doesn't mean that they're not useful though. We derive fruitful insights and 
			qualitative information by studying these models. I was early on interested in finding 
			ways to bring such models closer to nature. In spin chains, one way is to introduce 
			boundary conditions so that the particles reflect on the edges. This means that the system 
			is no longer infinite, so that finite size effects become important. This work resulted in 
			two publications <a href="publications.html#p1">[1]</a>,
			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5042">[2]</a> and a review 
			article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3350">[3]</a>.</p>
